# secret-diary
A mini application to allow users to create accounts, login, and update a diary (text) entry.

The backend is written in PHP and updates to a MySQL database. It uses some jQuery for frontend and validation, a little bit of Bootstrap for styling.

The application uses sessions and cookies to maintain a login - if required.
